My first real JS assignment, where HTML and CSS were combined to make a functional browser-based game of battleship.  At first I was following tips and instructions from "Head First JavaScript Programming" by Eric T. Freeman in trying to build this game, but I soon realized I had a hard time following text since I had different ideas on how to make code work in my mind.  

Since tutorial from this book generates just three ships with same length (3), I've decided to go couple of steps further and to generate ships of all sizes as following : Carrier (5), Battleship (4), Submarine (3), Cruiser (3) and Destroyer (2). Code is pretty simple, I hope you will find some ideas if you're starting to learn JS and DOM manipulation.
